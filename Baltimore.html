			</B>
	<p>What’s <i>one</i> thing this <b>thriving and beautiful</b> city can do to keep families from leaving for the suburbs? Have a strong organization like the Downtown Baltimore Family Alliance there to back it up, cheer for it and continue its grassroots programs.</p>
	<p>The <a href=http://www.baltimorefamilies.org/><em><u>DBFA’s</em></u></a> </a>mission is to <u><i>attract, retain and support city families</u></i> through programs like the:
	<ul>
	<li>annual school fair
	<li>advocating for equitable funding in Annapolis
	<li>partnerships with Live Baltimore. 
	</ul>
	Political and community outreach is not only important for this mission but a necessity.</p>
